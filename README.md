# neural-network-project
This project using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for "Image Prediction" using Python language.

This is image data of Natural Scenes around the world, contains around 25000 images under 4 categories: Building, Forest, Mountain, Sea.
This data was initially published on https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com by Intel to host a Image classification Challenge.

# Quick review Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning concerned with the emulation of human brain activities in software programs using layers of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which work similar to the human brain at some levels.

# Quick review Neural Network
A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.
Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so, the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.
